# Nearest Neighbor Matching UDF Library - for value exchange betweeen locally identical Cell Zones in ANSYS Fluent

This library may for example be used for the coupling of cell values between locally "identical" mesh zones. For example to make a custom rebuild of the porous media heat transfer 
algorithm of ANSYS Fluent. For example to make certain additions which are not 
accessible from the close sources application. A simple example is provided in 
example.c.

An extension to exchange properties between surface areas may come in future versions
of this library.
